Hello there,
I’ve been working on a draft of the API reference documentation for your function, findNeedles. While examining this function, I encountered a few scenarios that may be confusing for our end users.  For example, if a user inputs special character(s) along with a word (i.e. “Hello!”) in the parameter haystack, is it a feature by design that special characters would be differentiated by the function when comparing it to the same word (“Hello”) in the parameter needles?
I also noted a few concerns regarding usability. In the source code provided, there were no comments explaining the functionality for each line of code. While I understand this function was aimed at experienced Java programmers, I felt some comments defining the function and the parameters would’ve been helpful for our less experienced end users. 
Thanks,
Amson
